<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Probability and statistics are at the heart of Poker.  Poker is one of the 
games that is more dependent on chance ("luck of the draw") than on skill.  The 
skill in Poker usually revolves around the Bet and Bluff, not what is dealt.  
Variations of Poker sometimes try to add skill back into the game.  Techniques 
used range from dropping and redealing cards (for example, 5-Card Draw) to using
a set of common cards that all players share (Texas Hold 'em), and having 
players match three cards of their five with the two on the table.</p>

<p>Thus I thought it would be interesting to create a table of the probabilities.
Let me introduce some of the "magic" numbers that are common when dealing with a
playing card deck:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are <b>4</b> suits in a deck.
<li>There are <b>13</b> cards in a suit.
<li>There are a total of <b>52</b> cards in a deck.
<li>A deck usually has <b>2</b> jokers, raising the total to <b>54</b> when 
playing with jokers.
<li>Games <i>generally</i> deal <b>5</b> or <b>7</b> cards. (I'll focus on five 
for now.)
<li>The total number of 5-card hands that can be dealt from a deck of 52 cards
is <b>2598960</b> and is referred to as <tt>52 C 5</tt>.  (<i>n</i> C <i>r</i>
represents the number of possible combinations of <i>r</i> items out of <i>n</i>
items.  nCr from the Math | Probability menu in the graphing calculator performs
this.)
</ul>

<p>You find that these numbers are used a lot, usually in the denominator of the
ratios.</p>

<p>An interesting sidenote I read mentioned that the hands are basically 
arranged by probability, while the way to determine the difference between two 
of the same is hand is generally arbitrary and sometimes counter to probability.
</p>

<p>I've tried doing the math myself (so there may be mistakes), and I've tried
to show my work.  Click the headings to show the text.</p>
