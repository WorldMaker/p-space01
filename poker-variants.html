<h1>Variants</h1>

<p>There are many variants of poker.  Too many to list here, as there are whole 
web sites dedicated to just the variants of Poker.  What I wanted to mention was 
one interesting variation I have found, using a five-suit deck (65-67 cards), 
such as the one you can buy from <a href="http://www.stardeck.com">Star Deck</a>.
(An interesting trivia note:  At one time five-suit decks were very popular in 
the United States).  This of course changes the probabilities quite a bit, and
adds a few new types of hands.  I think this may be interesting to do a table
of that... </p>

   <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="white">
   <tr>
   <td><img src="poker-bar-left.png"></td>
   <td style="background: url('poker-bar-middle.png')">
   <font color="black">Suits of the Star Deck: </font> 
   <img src="cardgame/spadesblack.bmp" alt="Spades">
   <img src="cardgame/diamondsred.bmp" alt="Diamonds">
   <img src="cardgame/heartsred.bmp" alt="Hearts">
   <img src="cardgame/clubsblack.bmp" alt="Clubs">
   <img src="cardgame/starsred.bmp" alt="Star">
   </td>
   <td><img src="poker-bar-right.png"></td>
   </tr>
   </table>

<p>Not to mention the fact that with this web page I have used only a small
subset of the graphics I had created as part of my "m-deck", which has 4 colors
with 20 suits each (total of 80 suits)...  I wonder what kind of a poker game
could be played with a 1080-card deck.  Also, Jokers need to be considered...</p>

<p><b>Are <i>you</i> up for the challenge?</b> (Or am I, for that matter...)</p>
